    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "For this model, we decided to use the ResNet50 (Deep Residual Networks with 50 layers) to help us determine whether a given short video input can be classified as an active crime.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this python notebook, we will explore the use of features in order to re-train a model's trained weights (in the dense layers and some layers from the original model) to recognize crimes without the need to train the full model from scratch (which usually requires a large amount of data).\n",
    "\n",
    "ResNet has an exotic architecture also called \"network on network architecture\". Such micro-architecture modules refer to the building blocks that make up the network. Together with the standard layers, a macho-architecture is formed and \"residual learning\" is introduced. Ever since introduced by He et al., ResNets have demostrated that deep networks can be trained with a standard SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) optimizer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Deep convolutional neural networks have led to a series of breakthroughs for image classification. Many other visual recognition tasks have also greatly benefited from very deep models. Over the years there is a trend to go more deeper to solve more complex tasks and to also increase/improve the classification/recognition accuracy. But, as we go deeper, the training of neural network becomes difficult; the accuracy saturates and even degrades. Residual Learning tries to solve both these problems.\n",
    "In general, in a deep convolutional neural network, several layers are stacked and are trained to the task at hand. The network learns several low/mid/high level features at the end of its layers. In residual learning, instead of trying to learn some features, we try to learn some residual. Residual can be simply understood as subtraction of feature learned from input of that layer. ResNet does this using shortcut connections (directly connecting input of nth layer to some (n+x)th layer. It has proved that training this form of networks is easier than training simple deep convolutional neural networks and also the problem of degrading accuracy is resolved.\" Writen By Kartik Ordugo, https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-deep-neural-network-known-as-%E2%80%9CResNet-50%E2%80%9D\n",
    "\n",
    "ResNets take activations from one layer and feed it into another layer much deeper in the network. This is called \"Skip connections\". they work because the identity function is easy for residual blocks to learn, as the same input is used and transferred into a deeper layer and in the case that the weights/bias fails to change the input (by applying weight/bias decay), the relu goes back to the skipped input. Thereby learning the identity function.\n",

    "\n",
    "When it comes to image classification, the ImageNet challenge is the de facto benchmark for computer vision classification algorithms â€” and the leaderboard for this challenge has been dominated by Convolutional Neural Networks and deep learning techniques since 2012. The state-of-the-art pre-trained networks included in the Keras core library represent some of the highest performing Convolutional Neural Networks on the ImageNet challenge over the past few years. These networks also demonstrate a strong ability to generalize to images outside the ImageNet dataset via transfer learning, such as feature extraction and fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) is to train a model that can correctly classify an input image into 1,000 separate object categories. Models are trained on ~1.2 million training images with another 50,000 images for validation and 100,000 images for testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "These 1,000 image categories represent object classes that we encounter in our day-to-day lives, such as species of dogs, cats, various household objects, types of vehicles, and much more. You can find the full list of object categories in the ILSVRC challenge here.\n",
